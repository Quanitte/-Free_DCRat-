## Description:

- Good day to all readers of this publication!
- Today in this article, I will explain how to avoid giving your hard-earned money to people who sell hosting services.
- We will go through the installation of DcRat and set up the hosting in a way that keeps users connected.
- Let's get straight to it.

## Registration of Necessary Accounts:

- At the moment, we will need hosting services and an account on Pastebin (for Dynamic Cloud Link).
- Currently, our task is to choose a hosting provider, such as SprintHost or Beget.
- Personally, I recommend Beget, but as of August 25th, it was not operational.

### SprintHost:

- To register with SprintHost, follow the link free.sprinthost.ru.
- Click on the red button and complete the registration process.
- Then, wait for some time for your account to be activated.
- Afterward, go to cp.sprinthost.ru and log in using the created account. It's ready.

### Beget:

- Navigate to the link https://beget.com/ru/hosting/free.
- Enter any name (full name), and you can use any phone number from any service (it is recommended not to use your real number).
- Confirm the phone number if required, and you will receive an SMS with login information.
- Done, now you have hosting.

### Pastebin:

- Now, let's register an account on Pastebin.
- Go to pastebin.com and click on "Sign Up"
- Provide the necessary information and confirm your email address.
- Done, now you have an account on Pastebin.

## Installing the Server:

- This is one of the most crucial and time-consuming steps.
- Log in to your Beget/SprintHost account.

SprintHost:

- Your domain is located in the "Websites" - "My Websites" section.
- Go to the file manager.
- Do not upload files to the root directory; instead, navigate to domaint/yourdomain/public_html.
- Upload the install.php file from the Server folder, which should be extracted from the archive beforehand.

Beget:

- You are interested in the label "Server" next to your domain name.
- Make a note of this name.
- Next, go to the file manager.
- In the File Manager, navigate to yourdomain/public_html.
- There will be a "Upload Files" button.
- Click it, then click "Browse"
- Select the path to the unpacked DcRat.
- The Server folder is essential here.
- Enter it and choose the install.php file.

## Server Installation:

- After the upload is complete, open the link http://yourdomain/install.php in your web browser.
- You will be greeted by the server installer.
- Here, enter the server password, remember it, and click "Install"
- You will receive a link.
- Go to the DcRat folder, run DCRat.exe, accept the End User License Agreement (EULA), and enter the URL link provided earlier and the password you entered before.
- You will encounter ServerMaster; click "Yes" and wait.
- You will see two checkmarks, indicating that the host has been set up correctly.
- Go to the "Builder" section, click "+" next to your domain, and you will see "Connected."
- Choose "Dynamic Cloud Link." Click on the text that appears in the field.
- Now, the most important part: go to Pastebin, create a new paste with this text (right-click - Paste).
- Click "raw," and a new link will open; copy it.
- Paste this link next to the text "Dynamic Cloud Link" and click "+"
- If it doesn't work, try restarting the program and repeating the steps.
- If nothing works, continue using a direct connection (Direct Connection).
